# ahha-website
This is an imaginary website of a food-fair business team back in 2019 called 'Ahha'. The site features a homepage, a menu page and a contact page which are consistent
with the team's business plan.

The purpose of this site is to complete a TOP's project regarding the creation of restaurant page and uses of webpack. It's also to relive our memories :DD.
